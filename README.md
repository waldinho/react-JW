<strong>Portfolio</strong>


npm install


npm start


<u>To do</u>:

1. Services (find images and add copy or maybe make circles bigger and title to front and text under flip effect???)
2. Portolio companies (use CircleHoverEffects???)
3. Portfolio case studies - e.g - http://www.james-waller.co.uk/loyal-subscribers/
4. More on about me.
5. Clean up unused code.

Maybe add some sort off novelty landing page before loading CV???
