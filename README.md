<strong>Portfolio</strong>


npm install


npm start


<u>To do</u>:

1. Portfolio case studies - e.g - http://www.james-waller.co.uk/loyal-subscribers/
2. Maybe change BetVictor for InterTrader?? Hmmm....
3. More on about me, not sure about emojis, look at some other images or icons, emojis look a bit tacky.
4. Fix wierd server error bug. 
5. Loading spinner??
6. Maybe add some sort off novelty landing page before loading CV???
7. Clean up unused code (maybe use css variables if time).
