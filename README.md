<strong>Portfolio</strong>


npm install


npm start


<u>To do</u>:

1. Portfolio case studies - e.g - http://www.james-waller.co.uk/loyal-subscribers/
2. Maybe change BetVictor for InterTrader?? Hmmm....
3. More on about me (emojis??? beer, globe, football, etc).
4. Clean up unused code (maybe use css variables if time).
5. Fix wierd server error bug. 

Maybe add some sort off novelty landing page before loading CV???
