<strong>Portfolio</strong>


npm install


npm start


<u>To do</u>:

1. Portolio companies (use CircleHoverEffects???)
2. Portfolio case studies - e.g - http://www.james-waller.co.uk/loyal-subscribers/
3. More on about me (emojis??? beer, globe, football, etc).
4. Clean up unused code (maybe use css variables if time).
5. Decide wether to use images or color backgrounds on flip effect for services.

Maybe add some sort off novelty landing page before loading CV???
